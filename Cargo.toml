# These dependencies are active during both the build time and the run time. So they are normal dependencies
# as well as build-dependencies. However, we can't control feature flags for build dependencies the way we do
# it for normal dependencies. So enabling the vendor feature for openssl-sys doesn't work for the build-dependencies.
# This will fail the build on targets where we need vendoring for openssl. Using rustls instead works around this issue.
