= Administration Guide

This administration guide gives you a better understanding on Trustify's deployment options, installing the Trustify
services locally, and reference information for Trustify's OpenAPI structures.

Trustify relies on external services for storage and authentication.
Trustify's services can use Amazon's S3 APIs to store object data.
You do not need to run Trustify on Amazon Web Services (AWS), because other cloud vendors, such as Google Cloud Storage
(GCS) and MinIO, implement Amazon's S3 API.

It also is possible to run Trustify on bare metal. Either on a server, or a local desktop/laptop, for trying it out.

== Deployment options

You have several deployment options to choose from for running Trustify.

=== Bare metal

Running Trustify on bare-metal servers requires you to download the `trustd` binary from source found on the
link:https://github.com/trustification/trustify/releases[Trustify releases] page.

There currently exist two variants of this binary, `trustd` and `trustd-pm`. The `-pm` version includes a few embedded
services, such as PostgreSQL and an OIDC issuer, which make it easier to run Trustify locally for trying it out. However,
this might be insecure, dangerous, and is not production ready. Still, it is great for trying it out and demoing it
without too much trouble.

=== Container image

Trustify services are available in an image, `ghcr.io/trustification/trustd`.

=== Kubernetes

Since Kubernetes runs containers, running Trustify on Kubernetes is easy!
We do not provide any out-of-the-box charts or an installation script, since many of the configuration options are
specific to the running environment.

We keep a Helm chart in the https://github.com/trustification/trustify-helm-charts to deploy a Trustify instance.
You can use this Helm chart as a starting point for your specific environment.

=== Data Migration

If you are already using https://github.com/trustification/trustification[Trustification] project, you might want to migrate yous SBOMs to Trustify (vulnerability and
advisory information are automatically ingested into the Trustify database).

As Trustification project uses S3 compatible storage to store original SBOMs files, the best way to migrate data is to ingest
them from the appropriate S3 bucket.

At the moment there is no automated tool to achieve this, but the process is simple:

1. Download SBOMs from the S3 bucket to the local folder
+
[source,bash]
----
aws s3 sync s3://bombastic-prod/data/ /tmp/sboms/
----

2. Now you can use any tool at your disposal to traverse this directory and ingest the SBOMs into Trustify, by posting them to the SBOM upload API endpoint.
+
For example, https://github.com/ctron/csaf-walker[CSAF Walker] library contains the `sbom` command line tool that can be used for this job
+
[source,bash]
----
sbom scoop http://localhost:8080/api/v2/sbom /tmp/sboms/
----

In the future we will provide more options to ingest SBOMs directly from different cloud object storage providers.
